#README

home of what is currently title geo-love: a demo for reactive geo-data editing

aka drawing of points, lines and polygons on a map and seeing them update on another connected browser window in (near) real-time

#PROGRESS

- styling? purecss.io?
- sessions? with individual logins for users, and different 'logins' for collective maps?
- different name?
- mapbox GL?

#NOTES

- can do custom styling if wanted, don't forget!
- drawing circles with leaflet Draw disabled for now, as circles aren't part of the GEOJSON spec... might be able to figure out a nice solution later.
- some kind of input for feature properties / data when a feature is created
- would be cool to have onclick popups for each feature, that contain the properties of each feature? i.e. similar to Google Maps popups for GIS data
